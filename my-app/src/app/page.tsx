    <div>While Singapore is generally under control when it comes to drug use, the issue unfortunately still persists, especially in lower income families where lack of information and awareness about substance abuse is prevelant. This is especially an issue for children, teenagers, and young adults, which are often the most common age groups in which drug use begins. In just 2023, more than half of drug abusers arrested in Singapore were below the age of 30 according to the Central Narcotics Bureau. Additionally, from 2022 to 2023, the number of new abusers rose by 19%. With this pattern of increase, it is extremely important that drug/substance abuse awareness is equally spread across Singapore, regardless of low, middle, high income status. </div>
